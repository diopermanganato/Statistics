# Statistics
In this project I collect some tools to compute statistical quantities.
The aim of this code is to be flexible to the most of situations, and it's meant to be used with GNUPlot for data representation. 
I use XCode for coding, which generates a bunch of useless code to work. The important file is in 'Statistica' folder.
